      <p class="p1">Cupcake Recipe:</p>
<p class="p3">Ingredients<br></p>
<p class="p2">
•	250g unsalted butter, softened <br>
•	250g caster sugar<br>
•	250g self-rising flour<br>
•	Pinch of salt<br>
•	4 medium eggs<br>
•	4 tablespoons milk<br>

Method<br><br>
•	Set the oven to 190C, gas 5.<br>
•	Tip the butter into a bowl and beat it until softened. Then add the sugar, <br>
flour, salt, eggs, and milk and whisk until the mixture is smooth.<br>
•	Use a traditional-style ice-cream scoop, or spoon, <br>
to divide the mixture between all the paper cases.<br>
•	Place both muffin tins in the oven and bake for 15 minutes,<br>
then swap over the position of the tins over and bake for a further 3-7 minutes,
until both trays of cupcakes are a light golden color.<br>
•	Remove the tins from the oven. <br>
Leave the cupcakes to cool in the tins for a few minutes.<br>
 Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool.<br>

<p class="p3">Vanilla Frosting<br></p>
<p class="p2">1)	Beat butter until creamy. Make sure your butter is softened to room temperature before beginning.<br>
    Use a hand or stand mixer to beat until smooth and creamy.<br>
2.) Add sugar, cream, and vanilla extract. <br>
   Beat on low speed until these ingredients are incorporated,<br>
  then bump up the mixer to medium-high speed. At this point,<br>
  you can add more confectioners’ sugar if the frosting is too thin or a splash of heavy cream if it’s too thick.<br><br>
3) Taste and salt. Add a pinch of salt to offset the sweetness.<br>
   Trust me on this one!<br>

 <p class="p3">Caramel Frosting<br></p>
 <p class="p2"> 1)	To make the Caramel base for The Best Caramel Buttercream Frosting you will need Brown Sugar, Milk and Butter.<br>
 2)	In heavy saucepan, combine the brown sugar, butter and milk. <br>
 3)	Cook and stir over a low heat until the brown sugar is dissolved and the butter is melted.Increase the heat to medium.  Do not stir. <br>
 4)	Cook for 3-6 minutes until either bubbles form in the center of the pan or the mixture turns amber. For us, that is usually around 3 minutes.<br>
 5)	Remove from the caramel mixture from the heat and transfer it to a bowl.  Cool to room temperature. <br>
 6)	Once the caramel mixture has cooled, add it to a mixing bowl with the powdered sugar.<br>
 7)	Gradually mix until the frosting is combined and the desired consistency. Add milk, a teaspoon at a time, if the frosting is too thick. <br>

 <p class="p3">Coconut Raspberry Frosting<br></p>
 <p class="p2">1)	Preheat the oven to 350F. Line 18 regular muffin cups with paper liners.<br>
 2)	In a medium bowl, mix the flour, baking powder and salt; set aside. <br>
    In a large bowl, beat the sugar and the butter with an electric mixer on medium speed. Add the eggs,<br>
  1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the extracts. On low sped, alternately add the 1/3 of the flour mixture,<br><br>
   1/2 of the buttermilk, another 1/3 of the flour, the remaining buttermilk and then the remaining flour, beating just until blended. Stir in the coconut.<br><br>
 3)	Divide batter evenly among muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full.<br>
 4)	Bake for 16 to 18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes; remove to a cooling rack to cool completely.<br><br>
 6)	In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter until light and fluffy, 2-3 minutes.<br>
  With the mixer on low, add the powdered sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing until incorporated. <br>
  Beat in the salt, then turn the mixer to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, another 2-3 minutes.<br>
   Add the jam and beat until combined. The buttercream should be light, creamy and smooth.<br>

<p class="p3">Cream Cheese Frosting<br></p>
<p class="p2"> 1)	Talk about red velvet cake, cream cheese frosting comes to the mind. <br>
2)	The two of them go hand in hand.<br>
3)	 Cream cheese frosting is basically a buttercream frosting with cream cheese added to it. <br>
4)	It is creamier, tastier and of course gorgeous looking. If you haven't tried it yet, it is time now!<br>

<p class="p3">Ganache Frosting<br></p>
<p class="p2"> 1)	If you are a chocolate lover, you would love ganache. <br>
2)	The basic ganache is made by heating heavy cream and further adding dark chocolate to it or you can even add chocolate chips to it. <br>
3)	The irresistible smooth creamy texture will leave you asking for more.<br>
4)	 We are sure; you will be left licking up the extra cream on your hands or just everything.<br>
